								<h4>Stock Market Competition</h4>

							<h6>Event details</h6>
							<p>The Stock Market Competition was successfully organised on 22 February in the New Sports Complex, in association with Dalal Street Investment Journal and Purple Trades.
                                    The event started at 12:30 pm as was scheduled, and teams (more than 80 in number) were set up in the NSC after due verification. The platform on which the competition was hosted by provided by DSIJ. DSIJ had specially curated an event on the platform which was open, only to the participants of our event. This platform simulated all the elements of a live trade on a real stock-market and enlisted various methods of analysis usually available to a trader. 
                                    After all the teams had settled, the volunteers quickly registered each team on the DSIJ website. This account served as the trading account of the teams for the entirety of the competition.

        This was followed by the welcoming on the stage of Mr. Kushal Jain, CEO of Purple Trades, a Bangalore based centre which provides training in investing and trading on the Stock Market as well as a variety of other financial services. Kushal explained about all the rules of the Stock Market Competition to the participants as well as cleared the doubts of every team regarding Short Sell, Cover and other miscellaneous things about trading. He also explained about the various methods of analysis that the teams can use in order to study about the shares, in which they are interested.
        After the guidelines were administered, the trading began at 1:30 pm. For the convenience of all the teams, the two giant screens on the stage ran business news channels live. The teams were all given virtual money 10,00,000 INR and their task was to maximize this amount by trading shares on the stock market. Each team was given complete flexibility in the choice of the shares they wished to trade in. Throughout the entire duration of the trading period, the volunteers were on their feet, in order to clear any sort of doubts the teams had regarding the competition.

<p>
        At 3:30 pm sharp, the trading came to a close (aligned to the market-closing time at BSE). All the positions of teams were locked. Then, Kushal engaged in a Q & A session with the teams. He answered all the questions asked, ranging from starting out in the Stock-Market to mutual funds to certain tips related to investing and trading on the Stock Market. The participants were all satisfied with his answers. 
        After the Q & A session, a break was given which was utilised to compile the results. The results were compiled and duly announced. The top 3 teams wrt. to their net worth as of 3:30pm were as follows:
<br>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Vikhyat Jk and team</li>
    <li>Dhruv Gupta and team</li>
    <li>Mridul Mohta and team</li>

</ol>        
</p>        
<p>
       
<br>


</p>
<p>
	<br>

</p>
<p>Mementos and prizes were presented to the winners by Mr. Kushal Jain. With this the event, Stock Market Competition culminated.
        The feedback received from the participants as well as the organising delegates, was largely positive and constructive. While many teams cited this as an enriching new experience in the domain of stock market, some also pointed out the slight inefficiency of DSIJ portal to dynamically update orders. Mr. Kushal was largely appreciative of the event and praised the overall execution and organisation of it, iterating his happiness at being associated with the event.
